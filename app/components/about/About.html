        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        Generator helps you with the problem of creating and remembering unique 
        passwords for all the social networks, online services and websites you 
        need passwords for. With just the help of an easy to remember alias and 
        one passphrase, generator creates unique strong passwords for your 
        services.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>And what if you forget the generated password?</strong> That's 
        the best part: <u>You don't even have to remember it!</u> Just come back 
        to the generator and type in your alias and secret, and generator's 
        algorithm generates the same password for you once again.

        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        All you need to remember for a website is its <u>alias</u>, for example 
        its domain or service name (facebook for https://facebook.com, onedrive 
        for Microsoft's One Drive, etc..) and <strong>one</strong> strong secret 
        passphrase. Generator then combines your alias and secret to together 
        and generates a unique strong password for you. For the more tech-savvy 
        of you, this is the meta algorithm. You can even create your own version 
        of generator based on this algorithm:
        <br>
        <br>
        <blockquote>
        <span>String alias = ...;</span> // Acquire alias<br>
        <span>String secret = ...;</span> // Acquire secret<br>
        <span>String s = alias + secret;</span> // Simply join alias and secret into one string<br>
        <span>String hash = hash('sha256',s);</span> // Generate hash of string s using SHA256 algorithm<br>
        <span>String base = base64Encode(hash);</span> // Encode hash from previous step into base64 encoding<br>
        <span>String password = base.substring(17,49);</span> // Take 32 characters from generated base64, starting with 16th character, all the way up to 48th
        </blockquote>
